# Starter Interface Blocks

This repository contains the building blocks for the [balena Starter Interface](https://github.com/balena-labs-research/starter-interface) components for deployment as independent Blocks. It separates each component in to individual blocks for use by users.

To add projects, copy the contents of the folder `template` in to a new folder for your project. Amend each of the files inside accordingly. Then move `deploy-to-balena.yml` in to `.github/workflows/` and amend the file name according to your project name.
